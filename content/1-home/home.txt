Text: <h3><p>Since my early childhood the dream of my life was to express everything I wanted to say through the language of MUSIC. I chose this language because, among other reasons, it enriches my life in every way. My multi-cultural background and the privilege of having studied with some wonderful teachers in United States and Switzerland on top of my personal taste has permitted me to create a musical world that has given a strong sense to my life. I chose to become a composer and a guitarist without even thinking about it. It seemed to me a natural path to take. After a number of years of experience as a student and player I started teaching guitar and music theory and kept-until the present- composing music in different styles with my personal language.</p></h3></div>
